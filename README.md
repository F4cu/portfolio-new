# Portfolio – Facundo Rosales

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It showcases selected work in UX/UI design, design systems, and data visualization.

## Overview

The portfolio highlights:

- Case studies around design systems and data visualization  
- Selected projects such as the Awin Design System and the UpSkill design system  
- A short biography and background as a product designer  
- Contact and external links  

The site is implemented as a static, single-page portfolio built with semantic HTML and modern, responsive CSS.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 (`index.html`)  
- CSS3 (`src/styles.css`)  
- (Optional) JavaScript for interactions, if added later  

The project runs as pure static files and does not require any build tools or frameworks.

## License

You can choose a license for the code in this repository (for example MIT) and add it as a separate `LICENSE` file.
